🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: C

Compiler: GCC

Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)

Tools/Editor: VS Code / Terminal

⚙️ How to Compile and Run (Linux)

Make sure GCC is installed:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc


Compile a program:

gcc filename.c -o output


Run the program:

./output

Example:
gcc armstrong.c -o armstrong
./armstrong

📌 List of Programs Implemented
1. Array Programs

Find second largest and second smallest element

Count frequency of each element

Rotate array by K positions

Check whether an array is palindrome

Shift all zeros to the end

2. String Programs

Count vowels and total characters

Reverse string without using extra array

3. Mathematical Programs

Armstrong number

Maclaurin series for sin(x)

4. Pattern Programs

Number and alphabet pattern printing

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, I learned:

Fundamentals of C programming

Implementation of arrays, strings, and loops

Use of conditional statements and functions

Working with mathematical series

Compiling and executing programs on Linux

Writing structured and readable code

Using Git & GitHub for version control

🧪 Tested Environment

All programs are tested on:

OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Compiler: GCC 11+

Programs compile and run successfully on Linux.

📸 Sample Output
Enter number: 153
153 is an Armstrong number

Input: 1 2 0 4 0 5
Output: 1 2 4 5 0 0
