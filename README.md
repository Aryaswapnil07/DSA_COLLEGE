C Programming Assignment – DSA Practice in C

Government Engineering College Kishanganj
Department of Computer Science and Engineering

Overview

This repository contains my C programming assignment solutions provided by
Government Engineering College Kishanganj as part of the core programming curriculum.

The objective of this repository is to demonstrate practical understanding of:

Fundamental C programming concepts

Problem solving using algorithms

Array and string manipulation

Mathematical and logical computations

All programs are implemented in standard C and tested on a Linux environment.

Development Environment

Language: C

Compiler: GCC

Platform: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian based)

Only the following header files are used across the project:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>


No additional libraries are included, as per academic guidelines.

How to Run (Linux)
1. Install GCC
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install build-essential
gcc --version

2. Compile a Program
gcc filename.c -o output


Example:

gcc program.c -o program

3. Execute
./output


Example:

./program
Key Concepts Implemented

Conditional statements

Loops and iterations

Functions and modular code

Mathematical computations

Array processing

String manipulation

In-place algorithms

Input/output handling

Academic Purpose

This repository is maintained for:

College assignment submission

Lab practice reference

Exam preparation

Strengthening core programming skills

Code Quality

Follows standard C conventions

Clean and readable structure

No unnecessary libraries
